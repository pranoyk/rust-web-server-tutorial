# rust-web-server

This project implements building a multi-threaded web server as described in the [rust-lang book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html).

The aim of this project is to build a simple web server. This project does not implment the best way to create a web server instead it is an attempt to understand rust in a better way as described in the [rust-lang book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html)
